 ## Todo application using Spring af Vaadin ##
 
 In this project i am following the tutorial made by: marcushellberg.
 
 Here you can see basic implementation of Vaadin and how to build
 a simple full-stack application using this framework.
 
 This application is a simple todo app with a list of todo's where you can add
 elements and delete them if they are completed.
